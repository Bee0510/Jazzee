# Jazzee

Welcome to **Jazzee** - an innovative platform designed to connect students, companies, and colleges.

## Assumptions
1. We assume that job seekers will optimize their profiles, ensuring they are fully completed with all necessary details (e.g., skills, experience, education) to increase their chances of being noticed by recruiters.
2. We assume that candidates will apply to each job posting only once, and there is no opportunity for candidates to edit or resubmit their applications after submission.
3. We assume that the app‚Äôs job search and recommendation algorithm is primarily based on matching a candidate's skills with the job requirements, assuming all other factors (e.g., location, company size) are secondary.
4. We assume that all communication between recruiters and job seekers will happen through the app‚Äôs built-in messaging system, with no need for external emails or communication tools.
5. We assume that once a job offer is made, there is no room for salary or benefits negotiation. Candidates either accept or reject the offer based on the initial terms.
6. We assume that job postings remain active for a fixed period (e.g., 30 days), with no option for early closure or extension by the recruiter.
